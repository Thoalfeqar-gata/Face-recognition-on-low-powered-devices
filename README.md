# Face-recognition-on-low-powered-devices
A face recognition application that can add new subjects for face recognition without the need to train a model. However, you can optionally train a SVM classifier to recognize the different subjects added to the database.
You need to have a webcam connected to your device in order to run the application. 
Steps to run the application:
1. Add a new subject. You can add as many subjects as your like, but make sure that they all have unique names.
2. You can now start running the program by choosing to run without a classifier.
3. If you want, you can train a SVM classifier on the subjects that you just added. After the training of the SVM is done, you can use it by clicking the "Start with classifier button"
